# HAGIA

What is Hagia?

Hagia is a 2D game engine and toolset for Python.

Hagia has two tools:

1. Sprite Editor
2. Map Editor

Unfortunately, Hagia does not provide a way of making music with it's toolset.
To do so, you will have to use any means you choose.
Just make sure all the music and audio are in the correct formats (`.ogg` for music, `.wav` for sound effects).

The `documentation` for Hagia can be found in the `DOCUMENTATION.md` file.
Along with this, some videos will be coming shortly!

Hagia will have a release soon, so stay tuned for that.
So please contain yourself until then, rather than suffer from a little too early of an adoption.
